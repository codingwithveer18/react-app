pure function : Those who doesn't have any external dependency to a state
        ex:
        function sum(a,b){
            return a+b;
        } 
        sum(1,2)

impure function : Those who have external dependency on state
        ex  :  
        let n=1;
        function sum(a,b){
            return a+b+n;
        } 
        sum(1,2)

In react we want components to be pure means if at level of props , state, context if these remain same then the output will also be same or desired 
if getting different result everytime then the component if impure

Whenever a function component re-run and it produces some return  and render the UI - Render 
if this render happens first time , then it is known as mouunting
if the component got removed from the DOM then it is know as demounting

Useeffect When : Jbh aapko on loading hi kuch krna ho , example ; Api calling   
Memoization : It's basically a caching , storing the result so that we don't have to do those things/calculations again and again
        example : Fibonacci series
        it can also be done at components level
